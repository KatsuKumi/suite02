    Two ways currency converter

    1) Write one function "numberToPrice" that convert a number to a price.

        If we got the number 4 in parameter,
        you need to return a string that contain "4,00€";

    2) Write a second function "priceToNumber" that convert a price to a number.

        If we got the string "4,59€" in parameter,
        you need to return a float number that is equal to 4.59;

    3) If we pass an empty string or negative number, return 0 or empty string;

    Is 0 positive or negative ?

    Write your own tests !
