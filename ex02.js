    Write a function "randomTemperatur" that return a temperature in Celsius or in Farenheight

    This function take one parameter that can be:
    
    "c" if we want to have a celsius value
    "f" if we want to have a farenheight value

    The number to calcul is a generated random number.
    You must create this random number.
    
    You must convert this generated number to the requested unit.
    So if I ask you to convert to Celsius, consider that the generated number is in Fahrenheit.

    Write your own tests !
